Behind every headline is a lost child, spouse, parent or sibling; a grieving family. I feel weighed down by their loss, but motivated strongly to help galvanise the tech industry towards solving these problems.", "Initial reports into the accident on Saturday, 17th April seem to suggest two things:", "To be clear, if the Autopilot was switched off - then it certainly can\u2019t be to blame for this accident, but my beef is less about whether Autopilot technology has reached human driving ability levels or not - but the effect that having a system in a car called Autopilot has on the psychology of those in the vehicle (and perhaps the cause of this any many other reports of Tesla drivers moving out of the driving seat while in motion).", "Here\u2019s where I\u2019m going to invoke the wrath of the Musk-eteers. Before you all send me hate mail, let me just say that I\u2019m a big fan of the man myself. When he sent the Roadster to space wearing a Stig helmet and \u201cDon\u2019t Panic\u201d on the dash, I thought this was genius. Yes, it\u2019s probably unwarranted space debris and a bit of a juvenile prank, but it captured the imagination of millions - and gave us a glimpse into the mind of an entrepeneur at the top of their game and firing on all cylinders.", "Musk himself has said that we need to be \u201csuper careful with AI\u201d and that it is \u201cpotentially more dangerous than nukes\u201d. He\u2019s right, and that\u2019s why we also need to be careful about how we market AI.", "The technology industry has a long tradition of naming things in unhelpful ways. There are two culprits:", "The first (and more mundane) is the naming convention of products in a purely descriptive sense. Steve Jobs once quipped that if Hewlett Packard were to bring Sushi to market, they would brand it as \u201ccold dead fish\u201d. Many products are simply labelled by the function they perform or features they offer. Unhelpful, unsexy, but the safe approach.", "The second (and more dangerous) is the naming convention of using metaphors to explain products. Data Warehousing is an old fashioned example. It speaks (somewhat) to what is going on, but is a very poor analogy as the real world warehousing is solving a very different problem (supply chain) to the digital version (archive and storage). Data Science is a more recent example. There is very little \u2018real\u2019 science going on in data science, and the level of professionalism that one sees in the scientific endeavour of companies such as Du Pont or Merck is a world removed from the hack-y, hipster horseplay that epitomises startups.", "And so, why is Autopilot always to blame? The clue is in the name. I don\u2019t yet have my professional pilot\u2019s licence but I know enough about the capabilities and limits of real Autopilot systems to know that we are far from the mythological utopia where human pilots can simply sit back, kick back and let the machine do all the hard work. Yes, there are situations where airplane autopilots can fully control the plane, and even land it - but the reason why it is OK to allow the term \u2018autopilot\u2019 to be used in this context is because it is a partnership between a highly experience and professional human operator and a machine. The human knows the limits of the machine, there is (certainly in a commercial plane context) redundancy in a human co-pilot, and most importantly - any transition between automatic system and manual control is measured, anticipated and seamless.", "Now contrast this with the \u2018Autopilot\u2019 system in a Tesla. The technology is breathtakingly incredible, and potentially transformative; but the problem is with the human operator who is almost always NOT a professional driver, doesn\u2019t have redundancy (in terms of a co-driver who can take over at any point), and doesn\u2019t offer measured, anticipated and seamless transfer of control. They therefore shouldn\u2019t be lulled into thinking they are or have any of these things - an unprofessional driver should never be in a cockpit with an Autopilot, unless of course that Autopilot can do every thing the human can do, in all situations.", "While we\u2019ll never know why there was no driver in the driving seat of this tragic Tesla crash, what we can be sure of is that being in a car that has an \u2018Autopilot\u2019 will create a false sense of security to the occupants and unless anticipated transfer of control can be solved is always going to cause problems in the machine to human transfer because the human will take time to dial back into the situational context.", "The solution? Call these systems what they are. Semi-Autonomous Limited Function Autonomous Modes. SALFAM might not be as sexy as Autopilot, but if Elon and others are serious about saving lives - I bet this one change would do exactly that."], "clicks": 482},

Bill Ackman's billion-dollar short\u00a0", "bet against Herbalife", "\u00a0is another iconic example of such a fight. In recent months, the trading frenzy at GameStop (", "GME", ") has again prompted a lot of discussions on the role of short sellers in the market. Despite the common narrative that short sellers are to blame for stock market manipulation and price decline, a healthy dose of short selling is vital for well-functioning capital markets.\u00a0", "An efficient capital market, where prices reflect accurate information about the company's fundamentals, allows CFOs to raise funds at an attractive price in the long run. Informationally efficient capital markets are also good at allocating capital to its best use: giving money to fundamentally strong firms while rationing it for the weak ones. Short sellers make an important contribution in making prices efficient, and therefore in the efficient allocation of capital across firms.", "Since the short sellers profit from a price decline, they have strong incentives to discover bad news such as corporate wrongdoing, mismanagement, and accounting fraud. For informationally efficient capital markets, the discovery of bad news is as important as the arrival of good news. The CEOs and CFOs of a firm have all the incentives to release good news. It is the short sellers, and sometimes the regulators, who are in the business of discovering bad news and making markets more efficient in the process. Improved information efficiency that comes from the discovery of bad news helps good corporations separate themselves from bad ones. In the end, such a separation allows fundamentally strong firms to raise capital at an attractive rate.\u00a0", "Months before the collapse of Lehman Brothers, short seller David Einhorn made a famous speech describing some accounting\u00a0", "discrepancies", "\u00a0in Lehman\u2019s 2008Q1 accounting statements.

Academic research finds overwhelming evidence supporting the positive role short sellers play in\u00a0", "improving market efficiency", ".\u00a0", "There are two other benefits of short selling that go beyond the discovery of bad news. Fearing these discoveries by short sellers, firms are likely to be more careful with their disclosures and corporate decisions in the first place. With their backs against the wall, corporate managers are likely to make better decisions when faced with heavy short-selling pressures. Such a disciplining effect improves the overall quality of corporate reporting, and it can also result in better performance in the long run. Tesla\u2019s recent performance can be partly attributed to this disciplining effect of short sellers.\u00a0", "Second, short sellers play a vital role in keeping price bubbles under control. Stock investors can be broadly classified into two groups: optimists and pessimists. Optimists, who are bullish on the firm's prospects, can easily voice their opinion by buying more shares of the company, contributing to further price rise. Pessimists, on the other hand, can only voice their opinion by selling shares. In the absence of short selling, a pessimistic investor can only voice her opinion if she already has the stock in her portfolio. Therefore, a restriction on short selling activities will significantly decrease their ability to incorporate their views in the stock price. As a result, the stock price will reflect the views of optimistic investors only, potentially creating an unsustainable price bubble.", "GameStop's share price has experienced large swings in recent months. If short sellers are unable to borrow and short the company's stock, there is a possibility that the price level only reflects the opinion of bullish investors. Therefore, the share price can be artificially inflated. Only time will tell whether the current price level is justified or not. Still, we certainly need some short sellers to ensure prices are close to the fundamental value, reflecting both optimists' and pessimists' views.", "There is always a concern that short sellers may not be investing based on fundamental information; instead, they may be trying to manipulate the stock price through their trading. Such manipulative short selling is undoubtedly harmful to the markets. We need better regulation to curb manipulative practices. But, as a whole, there is a lot to gain from short sellers in a vibrant capital market."], "clicks": 6371},

Pent-up demand for new versions of the Model X and S - which are now seeing some of their most substantial updates since they were first launched - is also likely to help.

VW Group common stock has gained almost 20% since the announcement on March 15, while Tesla stock has declined by about -10% over the same period. So what does VW\u2019s increased EV focus mean for Tesla in the long run? Although we think Tesla will hold its own in the EV market, we think the recent moves by the likes of VW to double down on EVs could eventually make investors rethink Tesla\u2019s lofty valuation.", "VW isn\u2019t exactly new to EVs. The company already has EV offerings across its brands and has invested in multiple partnerships targeted at battery technology, charging, and self-driving software. However, VW hasn\u2019t really scaled up, as its battery-electric vehicle sales stood at just 3% of its 9.3 million total vehicle deliveries last year. That said, the company now wants to make EVs its \u201ccore business,\u201d with plans to invest in six large battery factories while doubling down on its own charging infrastructure helping to lock in supply and increase control of its technology, much like Tesla. VW has the scale to compete - it sold over 9 million cars last year compared to just about half a million for Tesla and it also has a host of premium brands including Porsche and Audi that are likely to help its EV push. Also Europe, VW\u2019s home market, is now the largest market for EVs, with the government offering generous incentives and this could also help VW scale up sales.", "Now, we think that Tesla will also hold its own even as the competition increases, given its early mover advantage in the self-driving and software space and its strong brand image that\u2019s associated with high-tech EVs. Tesla is currently valued at $600 billion-plus (roughly four times VW) implying that investors expect the company will essentially dominate the EV market in the years to come. Tesla\u2019s outlook is also extremely aggressive, with the company indicating that it expects to grow deliveries at a lofty CAGR of 50% a year over a multi-year horizon. However, we think investors could re-rate Tesla\u2019s valuation lower if VW (or other mainstream automakers) manage to deliver compelling EVs that are well-received by customers, following through on its EV growth targets. For perspective, VW trades at a little over 35x projected 2021 earnings currently, compared to Tesla which trades at over 150x and this gap could narrow if VW executes well.", "Tesla stock has declined by almost -10% over the last two weeks (10 trading days).

So how will the strong vehicle sales impact quarterly earnings? We expect the company to report revenues of about $10.2 billion, roughly in line with the consensus estimates, and a jump of about 38% year-over-year. We expect Tesla\u2019s adjusted EPS to come in at about $0.99 per share - more than double last year\u2019s figure, driven by better-fixed cost absorption amid higher deliveries and stronger sales of regulatory credits, which we estimate are almost pure profit. However, our EPS forecasts are slightly below consensus.", "Overall, while growth is likely to remain strong, with Tesla certainly on firmer ground financially, we continue to believe that the stock is meaningfully overvalued, trading at around 360x estimated 2020 earnings and about 26x Revenues.

Apple ($2.2 trillion) investors value its ecosystem that locks customers in and gets them to keep spending on products and services, while Amazon ($1.6 trillion) investors are buying into a massive physical and cloud-based infrastructure that powers its e-commerce juggernaut.

Firstly, with highly effective vaccines being rolled out things should start getting back to normal, helping the economy. Now even an indication that the U.S. Fed could revisit its stance on ultra-low interest rates could hit valuations for high-growth stocks like Tesla. There are industry-specific risks as well. Mainstream players such as GM and Volkswagen have been doubling down on EV investments.

One of the hedge funds, Melvin Capital, lost 53% of its value, and had to receive an emergency cash infusion of $2.75 billion. Needless to say, these activities cost these hedge funds billions of dollars as the damage reports and aftermath are still coming in. In a recent article \u201c", "Warnings For Tech Giants And An Ode To A Simpler Web", ",\u201d I called out the ongoing threat of bots and lack of authenticity that is pervasive across platforms such as social networks and forums such as Reddit, Twitter, Facebook, etc. This is an identity and integrity problem that has the potential to cause untold damage in addition to posing an experience issue.", "The GameStop episode has been labeled as a showdown between Wall Street and Main Street.

Trading firms, such RobinHood, E*Trade, and others even stopped and curtailed trading in the stock. This saga rose to such prominence, that culminated with hearings in front of Congress.\u00a0 However, those hearings were a late damage control response attempt that neglects a major issue affecting the majority of experiences on the web nowadays, which is lack of authenticity. Congress, along with \u201cBig Tech,\u201d still missed that point for whatever reason.", "The openness of the social media platforms to malfeasance is a persistent issue.

Every account should be validated and traced to an actual individual and in obvious cases, an actual business or organization. What we are seeing is the product of nothing but purposeful neglect and a gap in the mission of what online interactions were built for.\u00a0", "It is time to gather around the principles of \u201cwho\u201d these platforms are for. Are online forums designed around the experience of having shapeless, anonymous bots consuming online engagements? Can the same be said for social networks? Do you have any idea who is behind the public comments that drop into your Twitter posts? Many people think they do, but the simple fact is that we engage in a virtual world where there is little validation and the experiences we engage in may not be human or genuine in nature.\u00a0", "The GameStop situation clearly illustrated that major networks and forums should be regarded as potential risk points. Every one of these risk points should be contextualized in terms of impact and the effort required to ensure a genuine experience and open exchange of ideas. Various technologies can help the effort towards a genuine web. For example, multi-factor authentication, account validation, biometrics, preemptive security monitoring, and other leading technologies provide ways to do this on financial websites. It would only take the will of the social media\u00a0 giants (with the help of technology) to improve the experiences and impact of these public meeting places in a positive manner.

The electric vehicle behemoth has already provided delivery figures for the quarter, noting that it sold 184,800 vehicles over the quarter, a 2.2% sequential increase, and a 109% year-over-year increase. So how are Tesla\u2019s quarterly earnings expected to trend? We expect revenues to come in at about $10 billion, marking an increase of about 67% compared to last year, although this is slightly below the consensus estimates of $10.2 billion. Revenue is likely to decline sequentially, as Tesla paused production of its higher-priced Model S and Model X over Q1 in order to make way for new versions of both luxury vehicles. We expect Tesla\u2019s adjusted EPS to come in at about $0.76 per share - more than 3x last year\u2019s figure, driven by better-fixed cost absorption amid higher deliveries and possibly higher regulatory credit sales. However, our EPS forecasts are marginally below consensus estimates of $0.78.", "Overall, while year-over-year growth is expected to remain strong, we still think Tesla stock is expensive. At its current price of about $740 per share, the stock trades at around 172x estimated 2021 earnings and about 14x 2021 revenues. That being said, Tesla stock still has momentum on its side, and if the company is able to deliver a solid earnings beat, it\u2019s very likely that the stock will rally. See our analysis ", "What To Expect From Tesla\u2019s Q1 2021 Earnings?", " for a detailed overview of revenue and earnings estimates for the company and how it ties to Tesla\u2019s valuation.", "[4/5/2021] Tesla\u2019s Q1 Deliveries", "Tesla", " said that it delivered a total of 184,800 vehicles over Q1 2021.", " [", "1", "]", " This marks an increase of about 2.2% sequentially and about 109% year-over-year. The delivery numbers are strong, considering that the company had to shut down its Fremont facility for two days in February on account of some parts shortages. Moreover, the broader auto industry has had to contend with a shortage of semiconductors and Tesla\u2019s numbers indicate that it likely isn\u2019t being impacted. Model 3 and Model Y deliveries grew by almost 140% year-over-year to 182,780 units, driven by stronger sales in China where the company now also produces the Model Y SUV. However, Model S and X sales stood at just 2,020 units, as Tesla temporarily stopped production of both vehicles. Although the company did not provide specific reasons for this, it is currently ramping up the production of refreshed versions of both vehicles.", "So how will these results impact Tesla\u2019s Q1 2021 results, which are likely due later this month? It\u2019s likely that revenues and margins will trend slightly lower sequentially on account of a lower mix of luxury vehicle sales. See our analysis on ", "How Will Tesla\u2019s Q1 2021 Deliveries Impact Earnings?", " for more details on how Tesla\u2019s deliveries have trended and how they could impact its earnings. That said, Tesla still looks set for a robust 2021, with production scaling up at its Shanghai plant and new factories set to come online in Texas and Berlin. Pent-up demand for new versions of the Model X and S - which are now seeing some of their most substantial updates since they were first launched - is also likely to help. During its most recent earnings call, Tesla said that it expects to grow deliveries at a CAGR of 50% a year over a multi-year horizon.", "[3/26/2021] How VW\u2019s Big EV Push Impacts Tesla ", "Volkswagen", " outlined a series of steps to accelerate its transition to electric vehicles, targeting market leadership by 2025, challenging EV bellwether ", "Tesla", ". VW Group common stock has gained almost 20% since the announcement on March 15, while Tesla stock has declined by about -10% over the same period. So what does VW\u2019s increased EV focus mean for Tesla in the long run? Although we think Tesla will hold its own in the EV market, we think the recent moves by the likes of VW to double down on EVs could eventually make investors rethink Tesla\u2019s lofty valuation.", "VW isn\u2019t exactly new to EVs. The company already has EV offerings across its brands and has invested in multiple partnerships targeted at battery technology, charging, and self-driving software. However, VW hasn\u2019t really scaled up, as its battery-electric vehicle sales stood at just 3% of its 9.3 million total vehicle deliveries last year. That said, the company now wants to make EVs its \u201ccore business,\u201d with plans to invest in six large battery factories while doubling down on its own charging infrastructure helping to lock in supply and increase control of its technology, much like Tesla. VW has the scale to compete - it sold over 9 million cars last year compared to just about half a million for Tesla and it also has a host of premium brands including Porsche and Audi that are likely to help its EV push. Also Europe, VW\u2019s home market, is now the largest market for EVs, with the government offering generous incentives and this could also help VW scale up sales.", "Now, we think that Tesla will also hold its own even as the competition increases, given its early mover advantage in the self-driving and software space and its strong brand image that\u2019s associated with high-tech EVs. Tesla is currently valued at $600 billion-plus (roughly four times VW) implying that investors expect the company will essentially dominate the EV market in the years to come. Tesla\u2019s outlook is also extremely aggressive, with the company indicating that it expects to grow deliveries at a lofty CAGR of 50% a year over a multi-year horizon. However, we think investors could re-rate Tesla\u2019s valuation lower if VW (or other mainstream automakers) manage to deliver compelling EVs that are well-received by customers, following through on its EV growth targets. For perspective, VW trades at a little over 35x projected 2021 earnings currently, compared to Tesla which trades at over 150x and this gap could narrow if VW executes well.", "Tesla stock has declined by almost -10% over the last two weeks (10 trading days).

So how will the strong vehicle sales impact quarterly earnings? We expect the company to report revenues of about $10.2 billion, roughly in line with the consensus estimates, and a jump of about 38% year-over-year. We expect Tesla\u2019s adjusted EPS to come in at about $0.99 per share - more than double last year\u2019s figure, driven by better-fixed cost absorption amid higher deliveries and stronger sales of regulatory credits, which we estimate are almost pure profit.

In comparison, the broader S&P 500 returned less than 3% over the last 5 trading days. Now, is Tesla stock poised to rise further? Although we believe the company remains fundamentally overvalued, trading at about 200x consensus 2021 earnings, Tesla has momentum on its side, and there could be more room for gains in the stock.

Apple ($2.2 trillion) investors value its ecosystem that locks customers in and gets them to keep spending on products and services, while Amazon ($1.6 trillion) investors are buying into a massive physical and cloud-based infrastructure that powers its e-commerce juggernaut.

Firstly, with highly effective vaccines being rolled out things should start getting back to normal, helping the economy. Now even an indication that the U.S. Fed could revisit its stance on ultra-low interest rates could hit valuations for high-growth stocks like Tesla. There are industry-specific risks as well. Mainstream players such as GM and Volkswagen have been doubling down on EV investments.
